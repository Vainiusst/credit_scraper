# credit_scraper
A tool that I created in python to help me automate a boring and arduous task of collecting various credit-related data (such as installment size, APR, etc.) from the Web, using Selenium.

The project is now more or less complete and is functional. The only things missing might be detailed comments abot what does what. Also, some error handling is implemented in some places and missing in others.
