# credit_scraper
A tool that I created in python to help me automate a boring and arduous task of collecting various credit-related data (such as installment size, APR, etc.) from the Web, using Selenium.

The project is now complete and functional. However, there is still room for improvement, namely introducing more comments about the functions and code, as well as some error handling which is implemented in some places and missing in others.
