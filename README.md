# credit_scraper
A tool that I created in python to help me automate a boring and arduous task of collecting various credit-related data (such as installment size, APR, etc.) from the Web, using Selenium.

I have done a bunch of competitors' WEBs but there are still some missing. I find it quite hard to automate sliders, so the only missing WEBs are the ones that do not have text fields for amount/term input and use sliders only.

Edit (28/04/2020): I have mastered and subdued the sliders by now and their entire nation are my loyal servants as of recently.

Files that do not have a corresponding .csv file, are not ready for usage. Files that do, are most likely fine and working.
